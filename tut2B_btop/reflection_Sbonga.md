Experience

Compiling btop from source was tough and time consuming, especially with my PC running Windows, which was slow. But in the end, it was totally worth it. I learned that when a problem seems unsolvable, it's not the end of the world solutions often come when you least expect them, even in the middle of the night. Overall, the process was challenging, but the final result was beautiful, and I gained a lot of confidence in tackling technical issues moving forward.
