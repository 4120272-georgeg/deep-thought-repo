MY REFLECTION
For some reason, I felt like doing part B of tut 2 on my host machine. I encountered a number of errors, mostly concerning the owner and version of "make" and "g++" that was already installed on my machine and didn't comply with the btop Makefile.

Using my VM and its Ubuntu OS, I ended up trying to install btop without compiling it first which lead to missing files in my install directory, namely, the all important btop binary executable =( 
(Probably rushed the compilation step because of my first attempt on my host machine)

After successful btop compilation and make install into my install directory, exporting the build path wasn't too much of an issue. I never understood why $PATH needed to be appended to your newly created PATH, but now I do. I'm so glad and happy I know why $PATH should never be omitted when adding a new build path. Imagine losing all your system commands, among others because of such a mishap. Truly mortifying :`)

Finally running the btop executable, the gui display and the feeling of accomplishment felt so good. I honestly found it really cool to manually create my own shortcut to access a program that I just compiled. 
Overall, a W (winning) and awesome experience that I gave my time to. Truly makes me excited for what's to come!
