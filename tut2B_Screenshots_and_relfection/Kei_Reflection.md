Compiling btop From Source Reflection

Installing an application from source was incredibly exciting. Some steps had great challenges, whilst others went smoothly due the gradual experience I am getting with each task and independent project. 

My first roadblock occurred when I tried to make btop. I got an error message stating that g++ was not found.  So I installed g++ and updated gcc. This fixed my issue.. Next I encountered issues with exporting the build path as I accidentally edited some parts of the file I didn't want to. I learnt about file recovery, backup files and furthered my knowledge of VIM. 

This process gave me insight into how one compiles files from source on a physical level, which is the most exciting for me. Hands-on experience is the environment in which I pick up new concepts fastest. It was thrilling to use all the skills I've learnt from previous tasks to get one larger task to run smoothly.
